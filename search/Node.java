A node in a search tree. Contains a pointer to the parent (the node
that this is a successor of) and to the actual state for this node.
Note that if a state is arrived at by two paths, then there are two 
nodes with the same state. Also includes the action that got us to this
state, and the total path cost (also known as g) to reach the node. Other
functions may add an f and h value.

You will not need to subclass this class.
